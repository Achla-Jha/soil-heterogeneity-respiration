The files in this folder contains python codes used to draw Figures for the manuscript entitled "A Soil Structure-Based Modeling Approach to Heterotrophic Respiration."
1. Figure 1.ipynb file contains the code used to draw Figure 1 showing CDF of truncated gamma aggregate size distribution compared to the literature data.
2. Figure 2.ipynb file contains the code used to draw Figure 2 showing how the model captured the effect of land uses on SOC in different aggregate size classes.
3. Figure 3.ipynb file contains the code used to draw Figure 3 depicting the relationship of different biophysical factors controlling the microbial respiration at a relative soil moisture content.  
4. Figure 4.ipynb file contains the code used to draw Figure 4 depicting moisture-respiration relationship for different heterogeneity scenarios.
5. Figure 5.ipynb file contains the code used to draw Figure 5 depicting moisture-respiration curves for homogeneous vs heterogeneous scenarios.
